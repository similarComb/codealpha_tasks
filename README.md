**“Hi everyone, I’m Aditya Mohanty, and today I'll present my Age Calculator web app, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring both light and dark themes.

This app takes a user’s birthdate, calculates their exact age in years, months, and days, and instantly displays the result. The HTML structure is semantic and clean: it includes a birthdate input field, a calculate button, a result display, and a toggle switch for theme selection.

Using CSS variables, I implemented the dark and light modes so users can customize the interface. I’ve also added localStorage support to remember the theme choice between visits, ensuring a consistent experience. The layout is fully responsive, so it adapts beautifully from desktop to mobile.

On the JavaScript side, event listeners handle both the age calculation and theme toggle. The age logic accounts for leap years, future dates, and invalid inputs to ensure accuracy. And when you switch themes, the CSS variables update instantly—no page reload needed.

Building this project taught me valuable lessons in DOM manipulation, responsive design, and state persistence. It was especially rewarding to solve tricky date calculations and ensure both themes feel polished.
